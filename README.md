Bitcoin Keygen
==============

This is an example implementation of Bitcoin private key and address generation.  It simply prints a mainnet private key (WIF) and a bech32 Bitcoin address, as well as QR codes for the purpose of creating an offline wallet.  Cryptographic functions come from [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).  The base58 and bech32 implementations are built-in.  It does not create hierarchical-deterministic wallets or use mnemonics.

## Disclaimer

DO NOT use addresses generated by this program to keep any significant amount of wealth.  Use AT YOUR OWN RISK!  The author of this program WILL NOT be held responsible for lost funds or any other negative consequences as a result of running said program.  No guarantees are being made by the author.
